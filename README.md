# Project Description

This project aims to reproduce a portion of the findings found during single cell RNA-seq analysis of pancreatic cells from human and mice samples by Baron et. al (2016). The referenced study used sc-RNA-seq data from 4 human donors and 2 mice strains for single cell analysis.
